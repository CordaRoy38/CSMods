Your victory speech was in front of an ecstatic crowd in South Dakota, and everyone could see the tears in your eyes. This is an astounding victory that political analysts will be studying for decades to come, and the climax of a chaotic past few years. This has completely shaken up the way the Democratic Party operates, and the next four years will be incredibly interesting to watch. Good luck with Vietnam, and here's to you.

The party stands at a crossroads. The Republicans were able to not only turn around their devastating loss in 1964, but in fact fully embraced Goldwater's brand of conservatism to reap two major wins in a row. The Democrats may be able to do the same in 1976 and even 1980, if you put in a good fight with this election. Or, they could nominate a more right-leaning centrist candidate, in hopes of placating moderates. In any event, you can always go back to the senate. Hopefully Nixon stays true to his promise of bringing peace with honor, and can leave the White House with dignity in four years.</p>",
