Turner, as of late, is a political chameleon. Sure, his position on environmentalism is clear as day, same with nuclear proliferation and even abortion. But on everything else, he's all over the place. Digging past the many, many controversial statements, you have an atheist married to Jane Fonda who has attacked unions, fired employees for smoking outside of work, run defense for China and Cuba, and has some, rather intesting opinions on overpopulation.

Except that he's gay.</p><p>Outed by Represenative Bob Dornan in 1994 on the floor of the House, he's been openly gay since. Though elected to an eighth term in Congress since, Gunderson has expressed interest in retiring, but perhaps there's an opportunity here. I mean, imagine this, we outflank the Democrats on social issues. Turner might be boinking Hanoi Jane, but he's not much of a classic liberal, in fact he can be pretty conservative on some issues. It's the party above all, Newt. Maybe there's an opportunity here.",
